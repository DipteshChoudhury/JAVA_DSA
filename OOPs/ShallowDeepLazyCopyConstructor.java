/*
 * Shallow Copy Constructor:-When we do a copy of some entity to create two or more than two entities such that 
 *                           changes in one entity are reflected in the other entities as well, then we can say 
 *                           we have done a shallow copy. In shallow copy, new memory allocation never happens 
 *                           for the other entities, and the only reference is copied to the other entities.
 * 
 * Deep Copy Constructor    :-When we do a copy of some entity to create two or more than two entities such that 
 *                            changes in one entity are not reflected in the other entities, then we can say we 
 *                            have done a deep copy. In the deep copy, a new memory allocation happens for the 
 *                            other entities, and reference is not copied to the other entities. Each entity has
 *                            its own independent reference.
 * 
 * Lazy Copy Constructor    :-A lazy copy can be defined as a combination of both shallow copy and deep copy. 
 *                            The mechanism follows a simple approach â€“ at the initial state, shallow copy 
 *                            approach is used. A counter is also used to keep a track on how many objects share
 *                            the data. When the program wants to modify the original object, it checks whether 
 *                            the object is shared or not. If the object is shared, then the deep copy mechanism
 *                            is initiated.
